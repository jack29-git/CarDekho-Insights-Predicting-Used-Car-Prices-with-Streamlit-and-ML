## 🛠️ Project Approach  
### 1️⃣ Data Processing  
- Import and merge datasets from various cities.  
- Handle missing values and ensure data consistency.  
- Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.  
- Remove outliers using IQR or Z-score methods.  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Conduct statistical analysis and visualize data patterns.  
- Identify key features influencing car prices.  

### 3️⃣ Model Development  
- Train-test split (80-20 ratio).  
- Test multiple algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).  
- Optimize models with hyperparameter tuning.  

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation  
- Evaluate performance using MAE, MSE, and R² metrics.  
- Compare results and select the best model.  

### 5️⃣ Deployment  
- Develop a Streamlit application for real-time predictions.  
- Design an intuitive user interface.
